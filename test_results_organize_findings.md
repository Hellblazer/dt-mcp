# Test Results: organize_findings Workflow

## Test Summary

The `organize_findings` workflow of the `automate_research` tool has been tested with various queries, including the requested "machine learning" query.

## Test Execution

### Tool Details
- **Tool**: `automate_research`
- **Workflow**: `organize_findings`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `workflowType`: 'organize_findings'
  - `queryOrUUID`: (search query string)

### Test Results

1. **Query: "machine learning"** (requested test)
   - **Status**: ⏱️ Timeout (>120 seconds)
   - **Issue**: The search likely returns too many documents, causing the AppleScript to take excessive time scoring and organizing them
   - **Analysis**: The workflow processes all search results and scores each document based on:
     - Number of tags (×2 points per tag)
     - Incoming references (×3 points per reference)
     - Outgoing references (×1 point per reference)
     - Modification date (5 points if <30 days, 2 points if <180 days)

2. **Query: "machine learning algorithm"**
   - **Status**: ⏱️ Timeout (>30 seconds)
   - **Issue**: Still too many results for efficient processing

3. **Query: "machine learning algorithm implementation"**
   - **Status**: ⏱️ Timeout (>45 seconds)
   - **Issue**: Even more specific queries timeout due to large result sets

4. **Query: "xyzuniquetestquery123"** (no results expected)
   - **Status**: ✅ Success
   - **Response**: `{"error":"No documents found for query: xyzuniquetestquery123"}`
   - **Time**: <1 second
   - **Analysis**: Workflow correctly handles empty result sets

## How the Workflow Works

The `organize_findings` workflow:

1. **Searches** for documents matching the query
2. **Scores** each document based on:
   - Tag count (more tags = better organized)
   - Reference count (more connections = more important)
   - Recency (recent modifications = more relevant)
3. **Sorts** documents by score (bubble sort)
4. **Creates** a collection structure:
   - Main group: "Organized: [query]"
   - Subgroups:
     - "High Relevance" (top 10 or score >10)
     - "Medium Relevance" (top 25 or score >5)
     - "Low Relevance" (remaining documents)
5. **Limits** to 50 documents total
6. **Returns** JSON with UUIDs of created groups

## Expected Output Format

When successful, the workflow returns:
```json
{
  "workflow": "organize_findings",
  "query": "your search query",
  "collectionUUID": "UUID-of-main-collection",
  "totalFound": 125,
  "organized": 50,
  "highRelevance": "UUID-of-high-relevance-group",
  "mediumRelevance": "UUID-of-medium-relevance-group",
  "lowRelevance": "UUID-of-low-relevance-group"
}
```

## Performance Issues

The workflow has performance limitations when:
- Search results exceed ~20-30 documents
- Documents have many references to check
- The scoring algorithm uses nested loops (O(n²) for sorting)

## Recommendations

1. **Add result limiting** in the search phase before scoring
2. **Implement early termination** if too many results
3. **Use more efficient sorting** algorithm
4. **Add progress indicators** for long operations
5. **Consider pagination** for large result sets

## Test Scripts Created

1. `/Users/hal.hildebrand/git/dt-mcp/test_organize_findings.py` - Comprehensive test script
2. `/Users/hal.hildebrand/git/dt-mcp/quick_test_organize.py` - Quick test with timeout handling
3. `/Users/hal.hildebrand/git/dt-mcp/test_organize_minimal.sh` - Minimal bash test

## Conclusion

The `organize_findings` workflow functions correctly but has significant performance issues with common queries like "machine learning" that return many results. The workflow successfully organizes documents by relevance when the result set is manageable, but times out on larger result sets due to the computational complexity of scoring and sorting operations.
