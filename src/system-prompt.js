/**
 * System prompt to help AI clients understand the DEVONthink MCP server
 */

export const systemPrompt = `You have access to a DEVONthink MCP server with 25+ specialized tools for document management, research automation, and knowledge synthesis.

KEY CAPABILITIES:
1. **Document Search & Access**: Search across multiple databases, read documents, access metadata
2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Build visual relationship maps, find connections between documents
3. **Research Automation**: Automated workflows for topic exploration and collection building
4. **Document Intelligence**: Analyze readability, compare similarity, extract insights
5. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine multiple documents, track topic evolution, identify trends

IMPORTANT USAGE NOTES:
- All parameters must use proper JSON syntax with double quotes (never backticks or single quotes)
- UUIDs come from search results or other tool outputs
- Database names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
- Use get_tool_help for detailed information about any tool

WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS:
1. Start with list_databases to see available databases
2. Use search_devonthink to find relevant documents
3. Use read_document with UUIDs from search results
4. Build knowledge graphs or synthesize findings as needed

ERROR HANDLING:
- "Document not found" - Check UUID is correct
- "Database not found" - Verify exact database name with list_databases
- "Invalid syntax" - Check JSON formatting, especially quotes
- Timeout errors - Try with fewer documents or smaller depth

For detailed help on any tool, use: get_tool_help with {"toolName": "tool_name"}`;
