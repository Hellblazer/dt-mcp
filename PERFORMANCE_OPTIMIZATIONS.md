# DEVONthink MCP Server - Performance Optimizations

## Summary

Implemented performance optimizations to address slow operations, particularly for `synthesize_documents` which was taking 30+ seconds for just 2 documents.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. synthesize_documents_optimized.applescript
- **Problem**: Original version processed ALL words from each document, causing severe performance issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Limited word processing to first 200 words per document
  - Capped common words list at 50 entries
  - Simplified word counting algorithm
  - Limited theme extraction to top 10 words
  - Reduced summary preview to 80 characters
- **Result**: Execution time reduced from 30+ seconds to <1 second
- **Fallback**: Service layer automatically falls back to native version if optimized version fails

### 2. analyze_document_similarity_optimized.applescript (Previously implemented)
- **Problem**: Timeout after 2 minutes when analyzing multiple documents
- **Solution**: Limited text analysis to first 100 words per document
- **Result**: Consistent sub-second performance

## Key Optimization Strategies

1. **Text Sampling**: Process only the first N words instead of entire documents
2. **Data Structure Limits**: Cap collections (word lists, themes) to prevent unbounded growth
3. **Early Exit**: Stop processing once sufficient data is collected
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Maintain original versions for cases requiring full analysis

## Performance Characteristics

| Tool | Original Time | Optimized Time | Sampling |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| synthesize_documents | 30+ seconds | <1 second | 200 words |
| analyze_document_similarity | 2+ minutes | <1 second | 100 words |

## Implementation Details

The optimized versions maintain the same API and return format as the original tools, ensuring compatibility. The service layer (devonthink.js) implements intelligent fallback:

```javascript
// Try optimized version first
try {
  const result = await this.runAppleScript('synthesize_documents_optimized', args);
  // Validate results before accepting
  const parsed = JSON.parse(result);
  if (parsed.document_count > 0 && parsed.document_titles.length > 0) {
    return result;
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to native version
}
```

## Trade-offs

- **Accuracy**: Sampling may miss important content later in documents
- **Themes**: Limited to most common themes, may miss nuanced topics
- **Use Case**: Optimized for quick overview, not deep analysis

## When to Use Each Version

- **Optimized**: Default for most use cases, quick analysis, large document sets
- **Native**: When full document analysis is critical, small document sets, accuracy paramount

## Future Improvements

1. Make sampling size configurable
2. Add progressive loading for very large documents
3. Implement caching for repeated analyses
4. Add performance metrics to responses
